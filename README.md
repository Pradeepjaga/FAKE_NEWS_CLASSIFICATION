# Fake news classification
    Fake news on different platforms is spreading widely and is a matter of serious concern, as it causes social wars and permanent breakage of the bonds established among people. A lot of research is already going on focused on the classification of fake news.

    Here we will try to solve this issue with the help of machine learning in Python.

# Data description
    > id: An identifier for each sample.
    > title: The title of the news article.
    > author: The author or source of the news article.
    > text: The main content or body of the news article.
    > label: The label indicating whether the news article is fake or not 
    (e.g., binary label, where 0 represents genuine news and 1 represents fake news).
# Steps
    1)Importing libraries
     2)Read Data
     3)Data Preprocessing
     4)Featuring Engineering
     5)Model Training
# Conclusion
     The model is built using XGBoost givethe high evaluation value, the value accuracy is 96with a comparison of datasets there are 90
